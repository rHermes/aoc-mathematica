# Advent of Code in Mathematica

I don't know [Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/), but
some of the solutions by [DFreiberg](https://github.com/HiggstonRainbird/AoC-2020)
really makes me want to learn it. It seems like a good tool for certain types of
problems and might also open me to new types of thinking.

The way I'll be doing this is that I'll try to solve each day by myself and once
I've managed to do so I'll look at DFreibergs solutions and learn some.
